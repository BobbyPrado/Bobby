            <p class="fst-italic py-3">
              Bobby Hisita Prado was born on September 29, 2003. He is the son of Herpio C. Prado and Anarlyn L. Hisita. His siblings are Brian Carl H. Prado, Bhiel H. Prado, and Blaire H. Prado, as well as Brisbelle H. Prado and Blase H. Prado. They live in Guinlajon, Sorsogon City. Prado is twenty-one (21) years old and attended Sorsogon College of Criminology Incorporated. During his elementary school years, he was an academic achiever, competitive, and highly engaged in school. He also played basketball for his school. Prado graduated from Guinlajon Elementary School. He is an honor student and received an award upon graduation.Prado's high school experience was highly intriguing; he attended Celestino G. Tabuena National High School for his first year. Hustle in transportation, but because of this, Prado has more options at this school, and he has become a member of the Supreme Student Government. Prado is quite active in school; during his high school years, he participated in several organizations such as Yes-O, SSG, and others. Prado's college experience has been difficult because he is learning a new culture. One of the issues is time management because her family owns a small business, which Prado manages.College is difficult for him; he must study harder in order to survive, as well as assist his parents with daily costs. Prado manages his parents' chickera and always checks on the chicken to make sure everything is well. Prado has additional pals, one of whom is his cousin Luigi Salseda Preclaro, the son of Ginabe Preclaro; the younger is Cristy Preclaro. Luigi Preclaro is really close to Bobby H. Prado. Preclaro is 22 years old and attended Sorsogon College of Criminology Incorporated. Beyond Prado's hectic days, he always found delight in helping others, thus he volunteered to join the Guinlajon young, which helps the community organize the young of Guinlajon.He will become an escort for this organization; Prado is a good escort because of his honesty about the group's finances or budget. He always documents the money and discusses it with the rest of the organization. This is one of Bobby H. Prado's best experiences managing the organization's funds. For Prado, it feels great because many people trust him to manage the youth fund, which he continues to do to this day. Bobby's aim is to one day become a fire officer so that he may aid many people and lead the path for other impoverished people to escape poverty.

        <h2>Plagiarism</h2>
        <p>Plagiarism is a serious issue that arises when an individual uses someone else's ideas, words, or research without providing proper acknowledgment or citation. It is considered an ethical violation in academic, professional, and creative contexts. Plagiarism can take many forms, including direct copying, paraphrasing without credit, or presenting another person's work as one's own. Regardless of whether it is intentional or unintentional, plagiarism undermines the integrity of the writer and disrespects the original creator’s efforts.

            One of the most common forms of plagiarism is direct copying, where the writer reproduces exact phrases, sentences, or passages from a source without using quotation marks or citing the original author. This type of plagiarism is often easy to identify and is considered one of the most blatant violations of ethical writing standards. For instance, if a student includes a sentence verbatim from a book or article in their essay without proper citation, it is a clear case of plagiarism. Similarly, even copying a few phrases from a source without acknowledgment can constitute plagiarism.
            
            Paraphrasing without giving credit is another prevalent form of plagiarism. This occurs when someone rewrites another person's ideas in their own words but fails to cite the source. While paraphrasing is a legitimate way to incorporate information into one's work, it must always be accompanied by proper attribution to the original author. Without citation, even paraphrased content is considered stolen intellectual property. This can often be unintentional, as writers may believe that changing the wording sufficiently removes the need for citation. However, the underlying ideas still belong to the original creator and require acknowledgment.
            
            Improper citation is another way plagiarism can manifest. In some cases, writers may provide incomplete or inaccurate citations, making it difficult or impossible to locate the original source. This could involve omitting essential details such as the author’s name, publication date, or page numbers. In other cases, the citation may not correspond to the specific ideas or words being referenced, creating confusion about the source of the material. Whether intentional or due to carelessness, improper citation can lead to accusations of plagiarism.
            
            Plagiarism can also occur in less obvious ways, such as self-plagiarism, where an individual reuses their previously published work without appropriate disclosure. While it may seem harmless, self-plagiarism can be a violation of academic or professional standards, as it misleads readers into believing the content is entirely new. Additionally, failing to give proper credit in collaborative projects is another form of plagiarism, as it disregards the contributions of other team members.
            
            The consequences of plagiarism can be severe, ranging from damage to one’s reputation to legal penalties. In academic settings, students found guilty of plagiarism may face penalties such as failing grades, suspension, or expulsion. In professional contexts, plagiarism can tarnish a career and lead to loss of credibility, job termination, or lawsuits. Even unintentional plagiarism can have serious repercussions, highlighting the importance of understanding and adhering to ethical writing practices.
            
            To avoid plagiarism, writers must ensure that all sources are properly cited and that any borrowed ideas or words are appropriately credited. This involves thorough research, careful note-taking, and familiarity with citation styles such as APA, MLA, or Chicago. Using plagiarism detection tools can also help identify potential issues before submission. Ultimately, maintaining integrity and respect for others' intellectual property is key to producing honest and credible work.

        <p>All about Virus Malware and Anti-Virus</p>
        <p>A computer virus is a type of malicious software designed to infect and damage a computer system. It attaches itself to legitimate files or programs and spreads when those files are executed or transferred. Once activated, a computer virus can perform harmful actions such as corrupting or deleting files, stealing sensitive information, or slowing down system performance. Some viruses replicate themselves, spreading across networks and infecting other devices. Unlike other types of malware, a virus requires a host file to function, and its primary goal is often to reproduce and spread, making it more difficult to detect and remove without proper antivirus software.</p>
      <div>

        </div>

        <p>Malware, short for "malicious software," refers to any software intentionally designed to harm, exploit, or otherwise compromise the functionality of a computer system or network. It can come in various forms, including viruses, worms, Trojans, ransomware, spyware, and adware. Malware can steal personal information, damage files, disrupt operations, or give unauthorized access to attackers. It often spreads through infected email attachments, malicious downloads, or vulnerabilities in software. Protecting against malware involves using antivirus software, regularly updating systems, and practicing safe online habits such as avoiding suspicious links or downloads.</p>
      <div>

      </div>
      <p>An antivirus is a software program designed to detect, prevent, and remove malicious software (malware), including viruses, worms, Trojan horses, ransomware, and other harmful programs from a computer or network. Antivirus programs work by scanning files, programs, and system activities for patterns or behaviors associated with known malware. They often provide real-time protection by continuously monitoring for threats, blocking suspicious activities, and alerting users to potential risks. Additionally, antivirus software is regularly updated to recognize new threats and ensure the system remains protected against emerging malware. It is an essential tool for maintaining the security and integrity of computer systems.</p>
